# Draw-Luffy-With-Svg

## Description

This script allows you to convert Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files into Turtle draw commands. Turtle graphics is a popular way to introduce programming concepts to beginners, and it provides a simple way to draw shapes and patterns on a screen using a virtual "turtle".

The script reads an SVG file and extracts the path data from it. It then converts the path data into a series of Turtle draw commands that can be executed by a Turtle graphics library. This enables you to take advantage of the rich graphics capabilities offered by SVG files and replicate them using the Turtle graphics library.
